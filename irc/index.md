# PHP-FG IRC

An IRC channel is available, in addition to the [mailing list][mailing], to
hold more real-time discussions, bounce ideas off of one another, and to chat
between ourselves in a slightly more informal setting.


## Channel Location

and is called [#phpfg][irc-channel].


## Web Interface

A <a href="/irc/fullscreen/" target="_blank">full-page web interface</a> is also available (opens in a new tab).
