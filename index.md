title:  PHP-FG — PHP Framework Group
---
# Welcome PHP developers


### What is FG?

The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the
commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main
audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community
is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to
do so, but that is not the aim.

Note: PHP Framework Group (PHP-FG) is based on the work of the PHP Framework
Interoperability Group (PHP-FIG), but it is a different group.
